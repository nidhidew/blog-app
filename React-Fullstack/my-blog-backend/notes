instruction for installing mongose is in the link

after starting the mongose we run the command
1. use react-blog-db
2. db.articles.insertMany([{
    name: 'learn-react',
    upvotes: 0,
    comments: [],
},
{
    name: 'learn-node',
    upvotes: 0,
    comments: [],
},
{
    name: 'learn-express',
    upvotes: 0,
    comments: [],
}])

3. db.articles.find({}) //to find all data in db
4. db.articles.find({ name: 'learn-react' }).pretty() //to find only one object data in db


when we want to connect the backend to the db for that follow the code in server.js
    const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017');
    await client.connect();
    const db = client.db('react-blog-db'); //we gave db name, it can be anything

after that start the server using node serve.js or npm run dev if nodemon is installed

mongose also should be in running

next open postman and try to GET for http://localhost:8000/api/articles/mongodb. here you will get data stored in db. if data is not present then 404 error.
